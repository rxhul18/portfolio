When the pandemic hit, everything moved online, and I got a my first laptop for attending classes. This led me to start my learning tech from HTML, CSS. \n\nIt's all started from my uncle who wanted teach some student , and i was one of them he started with how the web works under the hood in real, and i got inspired. Since then i never stoped learning buckled the seatbelt stared my ride in web. I then built some succesful project.\n\nThat‚Äôs how the journey began, and trust me‚Äîthe ride‚Äôs just getting started. üöÄ",
