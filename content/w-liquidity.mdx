# From Web to Native with React

React Native is a powerful choice for web developers looking to create mobile apps. If youâ€™re comfortable with React, transitioning to React Native allows you to leverage your existing skills while building real native apps for both iOS and Android.

## Why Choose React Native?

- **Transferrable Skills:** Most of your code will still be written in JavaScript (or TypeScript), so you can reuse many coding patterns and libraries.
- **Native Performance:** Despite writing in JavaScript, React Native maps your code to actual native elements, ensuring strong performance and an authentic app experience.
- **Cross-Platform Code Sharing:** You can build both iOS and Android apps from a single codebase, and even target web and server using tools like Expo Router.

## Why Use Expo?

Expo is a framework that simplifies React Native development by providing essential tools and services for production-ready apps. It bridges the gap between React Nativeâ€™s core components and the additional functionality you need, like navigation, notifications, camera access, and more.

With Expo, you donâ€™t need to navigate the overwhelming number of community libraries â€” it offers a robust standard library and CLI for easy project setup, prototyping, building, and deployment.

  **Pro Tip:** Meta officially recommends using Expo, as it provides a stable, well-supported framework to build native apps without the complexity of managing native code.
